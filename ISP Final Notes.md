## <u>HTML-Web-Programming</u>

### Definitions

> URL (Unified Resource Locator)
>
> DNS (Domain Name System)
>
> CGI (Common Gateway Interface) - Writes HTTP Responses and sends them off (Slow, and restarts process every request)
>
> ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) - Faster method than CGI but harder to write
>
> ASP (Active Server Page) - allows dynamically generated html to be embedded with Script (APS, APS.NET, JSP)
>
> XML(eXtensible Markup Language) - allows user defined tags (types)
>
> SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) - Standards for defining objects for the Internet Based on XML
>
> WSDL (Web Service Description Language) - Standards for describing web services for the Internet Based on XML

### Important

> - Java Script (Client-Side Code) - script tags (java script is default type)
> - PHP, JSP, etc (Server-Side Code)

## <u>Database</u>

### Definitions

>Database - A persistent store of data in a compact, secure, easy-and-fast-to-retrieve form.
>
>Database Engine - A software program that creates and manages database
>
>Database Management System (DBMS) - a database engine plus user interfaces and other supporting software
>
>Database Server - A DBMS that provides data to its remote client
>
>Database Schema - meta data for databases, defining tables and their attributes
>
>SQL (Structured Query Language) - standard language for database management
>
>Database API - Application programming interfaces for DBMSs

### Important

> - The-Select-From-Where-Clause (SELECT (Wanted Category) FROM (TableName) WHERE (Some value specification for a category))
> - Three Parts of SQL
>   - Query - Data Retrieval
>   - DML - Data Manipulation Language
>   - DDL - Data Defining Language
> - Pattern of Database Programming
>   1. Create Connection Object
>   2. Open the Connection
>   3. Create a Command Object
>   4. Execute the Command
>   5. Access the Data
>   6. Close the Connection

## <u>Java</u>

### Definitions

> JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler) - Compiler compiles the complete code all at once just into native binary code before execution. Faster execution.

### Important

> - Object-Oriented Language Supports:
>   1. Encapsulation
>   2. Polymorphism
>   3. Inheritance
> - Java is strong typed
> - Compiled and Interpreted
> - Compiled Once and run anywhere
> - All objects are references and it auto cleans the garbage created (System.GC)
> - Inheritance: A child object can be treated as parent but not vice versa

### Diagrams

>
> - JIT Version is the same thing but instead of Java Interpreter it is JIT.

## <u>JavaScript</u>

### Definitions

> 

### Important

> - JavaScript is NOT Object-Oriented because it doesn't support Polymorphism
>
> - Not compiled
>
> - Interpreted
>
> - Client-Side Code
>
> - <script>
>
> - Dynamically Typed (Auto Type Changing)
>
> - Arrays can have different type elements
>
> - JavaScript Pattern Matching Methods
>
>   1. RegExp Objects
>   2. On a string variable

## <u>JSP (Java-Server-Page)</u>

### Definitions

> 

### Important

> - Server-Side
> - Compiled
> - Java embedded into HTML
> - Object-Oriented
> - Dynamically Generates Webpages
> - Uses <%>
> - GROSS AS FUCK AND AVOID!!
> - 5 Steps of Web-Based server-side programming:
>   1. Get input as text from client
>   2. Convert text to numbers
>   3. compute
>   4. convert numbers to text
>   5. send output to client

## <u>Cloud Computing</u>

### Definitions

> Hypervisors (VMM) - virtual machine managers, the OS of the OS
>
> Cloud Computing - Computing technology and infrastructure offered by vendors **on demand**. 

### Important

> - Virtualization and Pay per Use model
> - Two types of Hypervisors:
>   1. Native - run directly on host hardware
>   2. Hosted - run on host OS
> - Advantages:
>   1. Cost-Effective
>   2. Maximum Resource Utilization
>   3. Flexibility
